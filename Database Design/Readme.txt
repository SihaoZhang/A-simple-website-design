#The purpose of this document is to illustrate how the ‘jobster’ website is designed which mainly includes two parts: the #design of database and the front end web pages design, including how it connect with database. The website is a new social #networking site called Jobster that focuses on graduating students looking for jobs. The site can allow students to sign up #and post their resumes and other information. Companies can also sign up and post information about themselves and job #announcements. Students can decide to follow certain companies (which means they will get all job announcements by those #companies), can apply for jobs, and can friend other students and forward tips and job announcements to their friends. Both #companies and students can also search for matching applicants and job descriptions. In this project, we use MySQL as the #relational database system. We apply Apache as the Server. The front end and back end will be implemented by PHP, #Javascript, HTML/CSS. We apply Bootstrap framework and jQuery for the front end development.
